# Basic Menu with Adjustable Homescreen

Ready-to-flash firmware for the OnionDAO badge. Flash it once and you get a navigable menu and a homescreen you can update from your computer anytime.

Built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Use this as your base layer, then customize with your chosen AI.

> **Buttons will not respond on fresh hardware.** The badge ships without firmware — nothing happens when you press buttons until you complete Step 3.

---

## What You Need

- OnionDAO badge + USB-C cable
- LiPo battery *(optional — the badge runs on USB power alone)*
- **ESP-IDF v5.5.x** for building & flashing — see the
  [VS Code + ESP-IDF setup guide](../../guides/esp-idf-vscode-setup.md)
  (⚠️ use v5.5.x, *not* 6.0+)
- Python 3 + pip for the art tool

---

## Step 1 — Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OnionDAO-git/oniondao-badge.git
cd oniondao-badge/software/examples/basic-menu-adjustable-homescreen
```

No git? Download the ZIP from the repo page and extract it.

---

## Step 2 — Connect the Battery (optional)

Flip the board over. The LiPo connector is labeled **BAT / J2**.

- Plug the battery in for portable use — the badge also runs fine from USB alone
- Always unplug the battery before any soldering or rework
- Flip the **ON/OFF** slide switch on the back to power on

---

## Step 3 — Flash the Firmware

> First time? Install the toolchain via the
> [VS Code + ESP-IDF setup guide](../../guides/esp-idf-vscode-setup.md) — then
> you can just hit **Build, Flash and Monitor** (🔥) in VS Code instead of the
> commands below.

Connect the badge via USB-C, then, in an ESP-IDF terminal (VS Code
"ESP-IDF Terminal", or after `. $IDF_PATH/export.sh`):

```bash
cd firmware
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/tty.usbserial-10 flash monitor   # use your serial port
```

The S3 target, 8 MB flash and partition table are preconfigured in
`firmware/sdkconfig.defaults` — no `idf.py set-target` needed. The Arduino core
is fetched automatically on first build.

If the upload fails to connect:
1. Hold **BOOT** (back of board)
2. Press and release **RST**
3. Release **BOOT**
4. Run the upload command again

After a successful flash the screen flashes white and shows the home screen. **Buttons are now active.**

## Step 4 — Navigate the Menu

Press any button from the home screen to open the menu.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| UP / DOWN | Move the cursor |
| SELECT | Open the selected item |
| CANCEL | Go back |
| LEFT / RIGHT | Flip pages (inside guide screens) |

| # | Screen | What it shows |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | System Info | Chip model, clock speed, memory |
| 2 | Button Test | Watch button presses light up in real time |
| 3 | I2C Scanner | Every chip found on the internal bus |
| 4 | RNG / Crypto | 16 random bytes from the hardware crypto chip |
| 5 | Display Test | Four screen patterns to confirm the display works |
| 6 | Hardware Guide | 10 short lessons on the physical components |
| 7 | Software Guide | 10 short lessons on the C++ firmware |
| 8 | ESPNow Beacon | Send and receive badge-to-badge wireless messages |

After 60 seconds of no activity the badge sleeps automatically. The image stays on screen with no power — press any button to wake it.

---

## Step 5 — Set a Custom Homescreen

**Install dependencies (one time):**
```bash
pip install pillow pyserial
```

**Run the art tool:**
```bash
python3 badge-art/badge_art.py
```

- Draw with left-click, erase with right-click
- Import any photo or PNG with **Open Image** — auto-resized and converted
- Select the serial port and click **Send to Badge**

The image saves to internal flash and persists through sleep and power cycles.

> The badge must be awake to receive an image. If it slept, press any button first, then send within 60 seconds.

---

## ESPNow — Badge-to-Badge Wireless

Menu item 8 turns on ESPNow, Espressif's direct 2.4 GHz peer-to-peer protocol. No Wi-Fi router or access point required — badges talk directly to each other.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| SELECT | Broadcast a beacon (your MAC + a counter) to all nearby badges |
| CANCEL | Return to the menu |

The screen shows your own MAC address, how many beacons you have sent, and the name, MAC, and counter of the last badge that reached you. ESPNow only starts up when you enter this screen — it has no effect on boot time or battery when you are not using it.

Flash the same firmware to two badges and navigate both to **8. ESPNow Beacon** to see them communicate.
